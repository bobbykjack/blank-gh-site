    Hi, I’m <a href="/2019/09/12/bobby">Bobby</a>, a software developer / video game enthusiast / struggling writer from near the sea in soggy old England. Check out anything that’s here, but please don’t ever leave.

            <h3>Fez</h3>
            <img src="/images/games/fez/forest-hut.png" width="320" />
        </a>
        <p>Fez is the kind of game with enough background to fill a review before gameplay has even been touched on.</p>

            <h3>Yoku’s Island Express</h3>
            <img src="/images/games/yokus-island-express/beginning.jpg" width="320" />
        </a>
        <p>Yoku’s Island Express is a bewitching combination of arcade pinball mechanics and enchanting metroidvania. But is it more than the sum of its parts, or does the gimmick result in a game which falls short of the two genres’ potential?</p>

            <h3>Baba Is You</h3>
            <img src="/images/games/baba-is-you/level0.jpg" width="320" />
        </a>
        <p>Baba is game. Mechanics are modifiable. Game is fun and challenging.</p>

<p>See <a href="/2019/08/01/nintendo-switch-reviews">all Nintendo Switch reviews</a> for the complete set. I am also writing a series of <a href="/2019/10/07/one-hour-reviews">One Hour reviews</a> which are more concise, and cover games I’ve played briefly, for free. And there’s more: I’ve recently started a series of <a href="/2020/02/18/switch-notes">‘Switch Notes’</a>, which summarise a game in ten points I consider most important.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>I have a huge amount of <a href="/2019/10/18/software">software</a> I’ve cobbled together over the years, gathering dust on my hard-drive. Some of this is worthy of releasing, and I’ll be doing exactly that, slowly. First up is <a href="/2019/09/18/about-stealthtacks">Stealthtacks</a>, a simple <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> client.</p>

<p>As of October 2019, I’m working on a little experiment called <a href="/2019/10/03/bunner-contents">Bunner</a>, a simple turn-based 2d puzzle game.</p>

<p>I’ll release more in due course, probably first via <a href="https://github.com/bobbykjack/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>All Nintendo Switch games</h2>

<p>I’m maintaining a <a href="/2020/02/21/all-nintendo-switch-games">league table of all the Switch games I’ve played</a>, whether I’ve reviewed them or not. It will be updated regularly, and the latest version will always be available here. Spoiler alert: <cite>Breath of the Wild</cite> is the greatest Nintendo Switch game, and will probably remain so.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>
