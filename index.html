            <h3>Ministry of Broadcast</h3>
            <img src="/images/games/ministry-of-broadcast/hush-bobby.jpg" width="320" />
            <p>Big Brother meets … Big Brother. In this pixellated tale of dystopian reality game show, you’re tasked with completing a series of platforming puzzles — by fair means or foul.</p>

            <h3>Spiritfarer</h3>
            <img src="/images/games/spiritfarer/hug.jpg" width="320" />
            <p>Spiritfarer is a captivating game with exploration, crafting, and platforming elements, woven around the moving stories of its characters.</p>

            <h3>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h3>
            <img src="/images/games/animal-crossing/airport.jpg" width="320" />
            <p>Animal Crossing is compelling and frustrating, a modern day doll’s house with too little to do, that will probably still have you coming back time and time again.</p>

    <p>See <a href="/2019/08/01/nintendo-switch-reviews">all Nintendo Switch reviews</a> for the complete set. I am also writing a series of <a href="/2019/10/07/one-hour-reviews">One Hour reviews</a> which are more concise, and cover games I’ve played briefly, for free. And there’s more: I’ve recently started a series of <a href="/2020/02/18/switch-notes">‘Switch Notes’</a>, which summarise a game in ten points I consider most important.</p>

    <p>I also write <a href="http://switchplayer.net/author/bobbyjack/">reviews for Switch Player magazine</a>.</p>

    <h2>Software</h2>

    <p>I have a huge amount of <a href="/2019/10/18/software">software</a> I’ve cobbled together over the years, gathering dust on my hard-drive. Some of this is worthy of releasing, and I’ll be doing exactly that, slowly. First up is <a href="/2019/09/18/about-stealthtacks">Stealthtacks</a>, a simple <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> client.</p>

    <p>As of October 2019, I’m working on a little experiment called <a href="/2019/10/03/bunner-contents">Bunner</a>, a simple turn-based 2d puzzle game.</p>

    <p>I’ll release more in due course, probably first via <a href="https://github.com/bobbykjack/">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h2>All Nintendo Switch games</h2>

    <p>I’m maintaining a <a href="/2020/06/12/all-nintendo-switch-games">league table of all the Switch games I’ve played</a>, whether I’ve reviewed them or not. It will be updated regularly, and the latest version will always be available here. Spoiler alert: <cite>Breath of the Wild</cite> is the greatest Nintendo Switch game, and will probably remain so.</p>
