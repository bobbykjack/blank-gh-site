    Hi, I’m <a href="/2019/09/12/bobby">Bobby</a>, a software developer / video game enthusiast / struggling writer from near the sea in soggy old England. Check out anything that’s here, but please don’t ever leave.

            <h3>Baba Is You</h3>
            <img src="/images/games/baba-is-you/level0.jpg" width="320" />
        </a>
        <p>Baba is game. Mechanics are modifiable. Game is fun and challenging.</p>

            <h3>Box Align</h3>
            <img src="/images/games/box-align/level29.jpg" width="320" />
        </a>
        <p>Box align is a 3d game stuck in a 2d world. Its core mechanic suffers as a result, and it doesn’t have enough redeeming features to make up for it.</p>

            <h3>Celeste</h3>
            <img src="/images/games/celeste/part-of-me.jpg" width="320" />
        </a>
        <p>Celeste answers the question ‘how can you make a plot really work in a video game?’. It’s a question we should all be asking more often, particularly when this is the answer.</p>

<p>See <a href="/2019/08/01/nintendo-switch-reviews">all Nintendo Switch reviews</a> for the complete set. I am also writing a series of <a href="/2019/10/07/one-hour-reviews">One Hour reviews</a> which are more concise, and cover games I’ve played briefly, for free.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>I have a huge amount of software I’ve cobbled together over the years, gathering dust on my hard-drive. Some of this is worthy of releasing, and I’ll be doing exactly that, slowly. First up is <a href="/2019/09/18/about-stealthtacks">Stealthtacks</a>, a simple <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> client.</p>

<p>As of October 2019, I’m working on a little experiment called <a href="/2019/10/03/bunner-contents">Bunner</a>, a simple turn-based 2d puzzle game.</p>

<p>I’ll release more in due course, probably first via <a href="https://github.com/bobbykjack/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>All Nintendo Switch games</h2>

<p>I’m maintaining a <a href="/2019/07/28/all-nintendo-switch-games">league table of all the Switch games I’ve played</a>, whether I’ve reviewed them or not. It will be updated regularly, and the latest version will always be available here. Spoiler alert: <cite>Breath of the Wild</cite> is the greatest Nintendo Switch game, and will probably remain so.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>
