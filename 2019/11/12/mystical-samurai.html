<p><b>This is a real joy, a retro title done so well that it’s slightly cruel it’s not a full game!</b></p>

<h2>GBJam</h2>

<p>
<cite>Mystical Samurai</cite> is another GBJam game — in fact, <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-7/results">it won the event</a> that <cite><a href="/2019/10/31/gum-girl">Gum Girl</a></cite> finished 2nd in. Whilst both are excellent mini-games, I think that ordering is justified.
</p>

<h2>Smoother</h2>

<p>
As soon as I started playing <cite>Mystical Samurai</cite>, it gave me a big old nostaliga hit: the graphics, the gameplay, that soundtrack — it really feels like every bit the Game Boy game. In fact, visually, it’s a slight improvement on any GB title that I remember playing, certainly smoother anyway.</p>

<h2>Platformer</h2>

<p>The game itself is a pretty standard platformer, with some common tried-and-tested devices — there’s nothing particularly original here, it’s just done so very well. Everyone will have their own reference point, but I was reminded in particular of <cite>Gargoyle’s Quest</cite> and <cite>Castlevania</cite>, both much-loved classics on this platform.</p>

<h2>Boss-per-level</h2>

<p>The one real nod to originality is the boss-per-level aspect, and this is, of course, very welcome in a game with just 3 levels. Level 1’s boss was definitely a touch on the easy side, but the second ws tougher, and the final boss was a real challenge.</p>

<h2>Challenge</h2>

<p>That boss deserves a proper mention, because it’s very well done: tough, but fair. There are four different, predictable phases, and each is fairly manageable, but there’s challenge in remembering which phase is next, and having to react quite differently to each.</p>

<h2>Accomplishment</h2>

<p>There’s so much polish here — even the password system is a joy to use! — and although I suffered one crash, this is a strong accomplishment overall, and one I’d hope to see developed further.</p>
