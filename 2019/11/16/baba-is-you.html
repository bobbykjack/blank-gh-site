<ol>
<li>Baba Is You is a 2d, grid-based <b>puzzle</b> game in which, by default, your aim is to move Baba, turn-by-turn, to the Flag</li>

<li>But you can change the <b>rules</b>: everything from “wall is stop” to “flag is win” is a collection of tiles, in the level, which can be moved and rearranged to alter almost everything about the game</li>

<li>Baba Is You really requires you to stop and think, often even with hands off the controller; it’s one of the <b>slowest</b> games I’ve played</li>

<li>It’s very <b>difficult</b>, too</li>

<li>But, in one of the greatest pieces of game design I’ve seen recently, it has an <b>undo</b> action — this is an absolute must</li>

<li>The graphics are very basic, old-school block colour & <b>low-res</b>, but they animate in a frantic vibrating kinda way, which is quite charming</li>

<li>The puzzles really challenge you to think in very different ways, and they often <b>combine</b> semantics, physicality, and timing</li>

<li>The game contains over <b>200</b> levels, but can be finished in as few as 27</li>

<li>The game costs £<b>11.29</b> and that is excellent value</li>

<li>Baba Is You was created by <a href="http://www.hempuli.com/"><b>Arvi Teikari</b></a> between 2017—2019 and, wonderfully, is still being developed</li>
