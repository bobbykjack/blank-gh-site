<h1>The Way Remastered</h1>

<p><b><cite>The Way Remastered</cite> has some problems, but it pays homage to a certain style of challenging action platformer very well indeed</b></p>

<p><cite>The Way Remastered</cite> is full of nostalgia, from the pixelated landscape, to the LucasArts-esque typography, and the 2.5d perspective. It faithfully recreates the look and feel of the 16-bit, Amiga platform so perfectly, that old-school fans such as myself canâ€™t help but be delighted right from the off.</p>

<p class="caption">The first thirty seconds are really just intro, but they at least demonstrate some of the beautiful pixel graphics on show</p>

<p>The graphics have clearly been lovingly created, and the backdrops of these alien worlds are â€˜paintedâ€™ gorgeously, but some of the character artwork and animation (of the â€˜assistantâ€™ character, in particular) could have been more polished. I loved the way text labels faded into view as I got closer to the relevant object, and the viewport scrolled to reveal doors opened by switches that were far, far away â€” these little touches go a long way.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d say at least 75% of the puzzles were engaging, and a good level of difficulty; some, unfortunately, were a let-down. At worst, the real challenge was understanding how the puzzle worked, rather than solving it. On one or two occasions, I gave up and â€˜brute forcedâ€™ them by trial-and-error, which isn't too much fun, nor is it the sign of a well-designed puzzle. But the puzzles that work, especially the highly inventive tasks based around skills that you gain, are good fun if you like a bit of cognitive exercise.</p>

</figure>

<p>I adore the multi-genre aspect of this game. Itâ€™s so reminiscent of the Amiga era, I canâ€™t imagine the creator wasnâ€™t influenced by that platform. I'm concerned the combination might feel too odd to some, but I really enjoyed the switching from one form to another. And the ending section switches the gameplay up once more, which surprised me, but left a smile on my face.</p>

<p>Much has been made of the story which, admittedly, is well told and moving on occasion. But weâ€™re not talking <cite>Hollow Knight</cite> levels of depth and characterisation here â€” this is a short action game, primarily.</p>

<p>Some of the platforming takes frustration to a new level. Iâ€™m not sure how intentional that is, but it borders, at times, on masochistic. If you fall from about three times your own height, you die; call me wild and reckless, but I donâ€™t think that would <em>quite</em> be the case irl. Some of the gaps that require you to jump <em>only a little bit</em> but not <em>quite</em> the-smallest-you-can are incredibly fiddly. And I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever played a game in which descending a ladder is so awkward.</p>

    <figcaption>Throughout the game, various memories can be â€˜examinedâ€™ to reveal background to the plot, a technique also seen in <cite>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</cite></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The final genre to discuss is the combat, which usually consists of shooting, in one form or another. In a similar game from the original era, you might have utilised the d-pad (or its equivalent) to aim â€” nowadays, we have a full 360-degrees to work with, courtesy of the analog joystick. It takes quite a bit of getting used to â€” aiming with the joystick in 2d and shooting â€” but itâ€™s rewarding enough once you get the hang.</p>

<p>The enemies youâ€™ll come across are varied and challenging but fair â€” the game is generous enough to leave them dead after one kill, most of the time. In fact, the game is also generous in restart points â€” which youâ€™ll find are used a <em>lot</em> since the platforming and combat are so tough. Even though its short, <cite>The Way Remastered</cite> has a good, balanced difficulty level, and tests the player in a variety of ways.</p>

<p><cite>The Way Remastered</cite> has a very unique style and combination of gameplay genres, which might make it divisive. I fall heavily into the camp that â€” mainly through nostalgia â€” is drawn to this kind of thing, and I wasnâ€™t disappointed. I <em>would</em> urge caution for anyone who doesnâ€™t already suspect theyâ€™d enjoy this kind of game, but those with at least a passing interest are bound to find enjoyment here. A couple of bugs let the side down a bit (one, involving a security light that becomes impossible to pass, seems consistent), but the restart mechanism at least provides an easy workaround.</p>

<h2>The Verdict</h2>

<p class="emoji">ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>As someone who never played <cite>Another World</cite> or <cite>Flashback</cite>, itâ€™s possibly a surprise I feel so nostalgic for this game. But it manages to get enough of the detail right, not only to recreate a memorable piece of the past, but also to add a suitable amount of flourish in the process. If a few more of the bigger downsides â€” length, fiddliness, some obscure puzzles â€” could be ironed out, <cite>The Way Remastered</cite> could be more than deserving of its full retail price. As it is, the frequent discount it sells at makes it an utter bargain.</p>

<p>I completed <cite>The Way Remastered</cite> in somewhere between <mark>5</mark> and <mark>10</mark> hours. Itâ€™s a bit fiddly to play handheld; I found certain sections much better with the pro controller.</p>

<p>I paid <mark>Â£0.89</mark>; itâ€™s currently at that low, low price in the e-shop. At full price, itâ€™s <mark>Â£13.49</mark> â€” this is on the steep side for a short game with little or no replay value. Wait for it on sale â€” you probably wonâ€™t be waiting long!</p>
