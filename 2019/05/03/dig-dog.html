<h1>Dig Dog</h1>

<p><b><cite>Dig Dog</cite> is a fast-paced, perfectly-pitched rogue-lite, offering an addictive slice of nostalgia</b></p>

<p>Right from the title screen, <a href="https://rusty.itch.io/digdog"><cite>Dig Dog</cite></a> announces itself as a work of great affection for the past, specifically for the golden age of video-gaming. Big blocky pixels, bright colours from a small palette, rhythmic chiptunes; the game calls back to 80s arcade games (and their home computer ports) more than anything. <cite>Dig Dug</cite> is the obvious title to draw comparison with.</p>

<p>The main gameplay here is straightforward enough to explain quickly. Each level is maybe one-and-a-half screens wide, and three or four screens tall. You (as the titular Dog) start at the top, and have to make your way to the single bone contained underground, somewhere near the bottom. Dig towards it, in various directions; avoid the enemies and static hazards; touch the bone, and progress to the next level.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the game relies heavily (almost exclusively) on the digging mechanic most recently revisited by games such as <a href="/2019/04/29/steamworld-dig-2"><cite>SteamWorld Dig 2</cite></a>. However, although I felt the mining was underused in that otherwise excellent game, here it shines. It has to really, thereâ€™s nowhere else for this game to hide if it doesnâ€™t get the digging absolutely right.</p>

<p>Maybe itâ€™s the overall game style, maybe a rogue-lite just suits this mechanic better than a metroidvania. But I think itâ€™s more than that, I think â€” somehow â€” <cite>Dig Dog</cite> manages to create a more interesting challenge from this core action, despite the random nature of its procedural generation. Playing <cite>SteamWorld Dig 2</cite> frequently left me feeling like I could tunnel anywhere and it didnâ€™t really matter too much, as long as I was moving in the correct general direction. Here, we have a game that really makes you consider where youâ€™re going, fully exploiting the puzzle aspects that arise from the nature of digging.</p>

<p>Time and time again, I find myself facing some kind of â€˜mini-puzzleâ€™, a certain arrangement of enemies, fixed hazards, and terrain that actually has to be solved, rather than merely traversed. That these arise from procedural generation is a testament to the level of detail that must have gone into planning whatever rules determine the layout.</p>

<p>It makes for highly tactical gameplay. You <em>can</em> attempt to rapidly drill down through the earth, like a canine possessed, an approach that <em>sometimes</em> works â€” and is highly satisfying, to boot! But most of the time, some obstacle or another will not only prevent you from doing that, but will inevitably lead to your death instead. Itâ€™s very easy to misread your location and end up digging through to the spiky, deadly floor.</p>

<p>Death is ever-present. With just two fragile health points (upgrades excepted), the challenge is often a balance between tactics and patience. At least youâ€™re not kept waiting; unlike <cite>New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe</cite>, for example, restarting is not a painful, drawn-out process. This matters for a game â€” and genre â€” that demands â€˜just one more quick goâ€™.</p>

<p>I think, above all, itâ€™s the enemy detail that makes this game so challenging. In the same way that <cite>Pac-Man</cite>â€™s ghosts were both simple in their rules, but apparently complex in their resulting behaviour, <cite>Dig Dog</cite>â€™s enemies serve their purpose very well. Thereâ€™s enough variation and unpredictability here to ensure a certain level of skill is absolutely necessary. You canâ€™t just blaze through these levels, however much it seems like you should be able to. And the varying enemy behaviour means there are no easy options: there doesnâ€™t appear to be any kind of reliable pattern that you can dig in to guarantee safety.</p>

<p>The graphics lend quite a distinct style to the game, although, for me, they bring to mind a much-loved game from the 1980â€™s: Alley Cat. Particularly the â€˜wave dogâ€™ palette. Thereâ€™s also some adorable animation here: little touches such as the dog wagging its tail or looking over its shoulder are subtle enough to be missed in the heat of the action, but they contribute to an overall humorous and approachable atmosphere.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m struggling to find criticisms here, but Iâ€™m also aware that Iâ€™ve only played <cite>Dig Dog</cite> for a few hours so far. There is undoubtedly more play time to be had, Iâ€™m just not sure whether itâ€™s another few hours or considerably more. In particular, Iâ€™m reminded of how I felt when I first played <cite>GoNNER</cite>, a similar rogue-lite that I picked up when my Switch first arrived, as I was killing time, waiting for <cite>Breath of the Wild</cite>. I played a lot of <cite>GoNNER</cite> (a similar game, but with shooting instead of digging), and thoroughly enjoyed it but, in retrospect, I think it just became a little bit too repetitive to persevere with for any longer. Now, <cite>Dig Dog</cite> feels like itâ€™s sidestepped that issue by creating enough variety in its early levels, and by pitching its difficulty at a <em>slightly</em> more forgivable level.</p>

<p>Another small problem I have is the lack of explanation. Case in point: there appears to be a control that â€˜barksâ€™ (or bites?) which actually doesnâ€™t do anything. Itâ€™s not that I have a problem with that â€” itâ€™s cute and a funny distraction â€” but it would be nice to know if it really is â€˜uselessâ€™ or if Iâ€™m missing something! Likewise, some of the upgrades that can be purchased (alongside a bigger jump, more health) are pretty obscure; itâ€™s not immediately obvious what effect, if any, theyâ€™re having.</p>

<h2>The Verdict</h2>

<p class="emoji">ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>Ultimately, <cite>Dig Dog</cite> depends upon the appeal of honing tactics, improving reactions, and determination to tackle the same <em>kind</em> of challenge again and again. Difficulty level is, therefore, key, and prospective buyers should beware that there is a <em>chance</em> theyâ€™ll either complete the key challenge quickly, or become frustrated at the face of a difficulty cliffside.</p>

<p>Personally, I appear to hit the sweet spot in the middle, where neither of these problems manifest. Iâ€™m keen to get back to the game and continue making progress. And, even if this game doesnâ€™t sustain my interest for an enormous amount of time, itâ€™s a delightful ride while it lasts. For the low price point, it offers great value for money.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve played <cite>Dig Dog</cite> for about <mark>2-3</mark> hours so far. About 1 hour was in handheld mode, which the game holds up <em>really</em> well in. I can see this being a great couch / travel game.</p>

<p>I paid <mark>Â£2.99</mark> for <cite>Dig Dog</cite> (the price it released at), which I consider an absolute bargain.</p>
