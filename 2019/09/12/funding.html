<h1>Funding</h1>

<!--<p style="font-style: italic; border-top: 1px solid; border-bottom: 1px solid; padding: 16px 0; color: #666;">During the month of October 2019, I will be <b>donating 50%</b> of any income I receive from any of the following sources to <a href="https://www.specialeffect.org.uk">SpecialEffect</a>, a fantastic UK-based charity which helps to ensure as many people as possible are able to play video games, whatever their physical circumstances may be.</p>-->

<p>Iâ€™m not (currently) asking for any payment for any of the
    <a href="https://github.com/bobbykjack">software I produce</a>, or anything I contribute to.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not (currently) seeking sponsorship, or advertisers, or any form of income that would affect the content and editorial independence of this site.</p>

<p>If you <a href="mailto:bobbyjack@gmail.com">email me</a> with a question, chances are Iâ€™ll reply and I wonâ€™t expect anything in return.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d like it all to stay that way.</p>

<p>That was all a rather long-winded way of explaining (pleading?) that I will continue to provide all of this, and more, as long as I can afford to. Any donations, great or small, will go towards that effort.</p>

<p>If you wish to, you can
    <b><a href="https://www.patreon.com/bobbyjack">support me on patreon</a></b>,
    <b><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/y3XC7Pu6m">buy me a coffee</a></b>
    or, er ...
    <b><a href="https://ko-fi.com/bobbyjackdotme">buy me a ko-fi</a></b>.
</p>

<p>
    If you canâ€™t afford a donation, Iâ€™d ðŸ’š it if you could come join me
    <a href="https://twitter.com/bobbyjackdotme">on Twitter</a> â€” itâ€™s appreciated
    <em>just as much</em>!
