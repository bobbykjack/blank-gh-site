<h1>Nintendo</h1>

<p>I’ve loved Nintendo games for many decades; the affair began with the <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Bros._(Game_%26_Watch)">Mario Bros. Game & Watch</a> system, which was released in 1983 (I probably got hold of it a couple of years later). I’ve owned about half the main consoles Nintendo has released since.</p>

<p>I’m currently working through the task of reviewing the 20 Switch games I own, including <a href="/2019/04/11/the-flame-in-the-flood">The Flame in the Flood</a>, <a href="/2019/04/29/steamworld-dig-2">SteamWorld Dig 2</a>, and <a href="/2019/05/03/dig-dog">Dig Dog</a>.</p>
