<h1>Bunner looks better</h1>

<h2>Version 0.5</h2>

<p>The focus in this <a href="/2019/10/29/bunner-0.5/bunner">version</a> is a graphical tweak, namely the grass tile. In previous versions, terrain tiles were a single block of colour, so grass was just a featureless green square. I wanted to add add at least <em>some</em> detail, and put in place a handy structure for developing tile graphics in future.</p> 

<p>I’m intending the overall style of the game to be very ‘pixel-ly’, but I wanted to vary that a bit, so the plan for now is to have ‘multi-resolution blocky sprites’. What I mean by that is that sprites will mainly be ‘very’ blocky, but will also contain some less-blocky detail.</p>

<p>With that in mind, my first attempt at meaningful tile graphics uses a ‘layered’ approach:</p>

<figure style="width: 275px;">
    <img width="275" height="89" src="./grass-tile-layers.png" />
    <figcaption>Mockup with progressively more detailed layers</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this example, the first layer is a 1x1 green square. This is the ‘base layer’ — it defines the core colour scheme for the rest of the tile, and it’s the one layer that will guarantee to show, regardless of zoom level (more on that later).</p>

<p>This single layer is simply stored in a 1x1 array, with a value indexing into the palette map:</p>

<figure style="width: 622px; text-align: center;">
    <img width="622" height="359" src="json-base-layer.png" />
</figure>

<p>The remaining two layers specify greater detail, with each layer rendered on top of those that have gone before it. The middle layer is an 8x8, and it’s a classic shaded edge used to convey a sense of depth. These tiles should look inset, as if they were actually tiles on a real game board (that’s the idea, anyway!).</p>

<p>The final layer is an approximation of blades of grass. It’s still a <em>fairly</em> low-res amount of data — 16x16 — but I’m doing my best here to create an effect that looks vaguely like grass, even from a distance.</p>

<p>Here’s the json data for the first two layers:</p>

<figure style="width: 646px; text-align: center;">
    <img width="646" height="558" src="json-two-layers.png" />
</figure>

<p>Note that each layer is a square with a length that’s a power of 2. This is planned intentionally: it makes scaling that much easier. In theory, I can support lengths greater than 16, but that’s my current limit since I’m displaying tiles at
32x32 by default, and single pixels don’t produce a pixel-ly result!</p>


<p>With three layers in place, it’s now an easy task to render this tile at
various sizes:</p>

<figure style="width: 201px;">
    <img width="201" height="88" src="./grass-tile-sizes.png" />
    <figcaption>Tile rendering at three different sizes</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the image above, the middle tile is the actual default size currently, whilst tiles either side demonstrate bigger and smaller sizes — these might be displayed, for example, when zooming in/out. Notice how the smallest view doesn’t show the final layer at all, because its 16x16 size, at half zoom, would result in individual pixels being drawn in a 32x32 square. That’s what I want to avoid — I want a blocky, pixel style.</p>

<p>Putting some tiles together gives us a reasonable effect, for now, as can be seen most clearly in the new level 4 in this version.</p>

<p>In the next step, I’ll look at more variations (so repeated blocks don't look so weird), or other terrains (e.g. earth), or possibly a new object to interact with (one that actually has a purpose!).
