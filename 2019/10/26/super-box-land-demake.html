<h1>Super Box Land Demake</h1>

<p><b>This great-looking Sokoban-like has some excellent levels, but too few of them</b></p>

<p>I went through a range of emotions playing this game, which is not an effect Iâ€™d expect a box-pushing puzzler to have. Unfortunately, they can be summed up with the words â€˜mehâ€™, â€˜ooh, promisingâ€™, and â€˜mehâ€™ again.</p>

<p>Push stuff around a grid, trying to get it into the right positions. Itâ€™s a puzzle sub-genre that has been done many times before, most notably by <cite>Sokoban</cite> (and countless variations), most recently â€” and, possibly, most inventively â€” by <a href="/2019/09/05/baba-is-you"><cite>Baba Is You</cite></a>. But <cite>Super Box Land</cite> sticks true to the <cite>Sokoban</cite> formula of pushing boxes onto targets, with no complicated extras.</p>

    <figcaption>Just as every other puzzle game does, Super Box Land starts off simple in the extreme, with a level that introduces the core mechanic, a level that itâ€™s impossible to go wrong in. Unlike many other puzzlers, though, this is pretty much it. Between this and level 100, all youâ€™ll really see change is the visual theme and the difficulty.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of course, this isnâ€™t necessarily a bad thing. People clearly like this type of puzzle and, I suspect, would play the simplest possible version of it: just plain squares on a grid would suffice, if those individual puzzles were captivating enough. And, to give it credit, <cite>Super Box Land</cite> makes a token attempt to go ever-so-slightly further with a 2-player mode, and a â€˜rewindâ€™ function (more of that later). But, really, it sets itself up to be completely focussed around box-pushing, so thereâ€™s very little room to hide here: we either have a set of good box-pushing puzzles, or we donâ€™t.</p>

<p>With so little going on in terms of gameplay mechanics, youâ€™d expect a tight, polished game â€” regardless of how well the puzzles have been designed. Sadly, the persistence of one single bug severely hampers the experience. Under certain conditions â€” and I have no idea what these conditions actually are â€” the box youâ€™re trying to push will, erâ€¦ become transparent. And sort of not-quite-there. You can walk through it (and sometimes will, accidentally). If youâ€™re of a particular mind or will, you can abuse this to <a href="https://twitter.com/pauljhaan/status/1186844283959205889">skip several levels of the game</a> entirely. I wouldnâ€™t mind so much if it was avoidable but, sometimes, it transports you somewhere you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have reached, so you then have a dilemma: carry on and â€˜cheatâ€™, or try to get back to where you were without moving anything else, not wanting to destroy the past by messing about in the awkward future tangent youâ€™ve created.</p>

<p>Speaking of messing about with time travel, there <em>is</em> a supported â€˜rewindâ€™ function which feels maybe like it was tacked on without being fully thought through. It just doesnâ€™t feel balanced: you can only undo a very small number of moves and itâ€™s usually easier to just reset the level by leaving through the entrance and returning. I went through the whole game barely making any use of it.</p>

    <figcaption>Tip: if your invisible time machine runs on batteries, donâ€™t store those batteries in bushes, <em>in the rain</em>. Thatâ€™s not good battery-storage practice.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, what about the puzzles? After all, Iâ€™ve managed to find fault with most other aspects of this game, how about the thing that actually matters the most?</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the first 3 (this isnâ€™t spoiling much!):</p>

<div style="background-color: black; padding: 4px;">
    <iframe style="display: block; margin: auto;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1hIEXhDAYLI?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="1"></iframe>

<p>They continue in much the same vein way for quite some time, but more variation slowly gets added. The main problem is typically how to move each â€˜boxâ€™ without putting it in a position from which it cannot be moved. Sometimes this involves moving it in an uninuitive direction. Other times it involves moving multiple boxes as part of the same â€˜stepâ€™. Some of the levels can be tackled in reverse: work out how itâ€™s possible to move a box onto each target square, then work backwards from there.</p>

<p>Many of the puzzles are symmetrical, with half the bozes on one side, half on the other. This makes for pleasing visuals, but in terms of gameplay, it just produces two smaller, identical puzzles. Itâ€™s not much fun doing the same puzzle twice, although it seems there is sometimes a concession to this â€” e.g. one half is upside-down, at least.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s slightly annoying that the boxes that are key to the game arenâ€™t â€¦ really boxes? Am I the only one seeing that weird protrusion at the top that kinda makes them look like some kind of sleeping bag or fridge freezer. They sure arenâ€™t the thing in this picture:</p>

</figure>

<p>Thatâ€™s â€¦ well, itâ€™s a least a <em>cube</em> if not really looking quite like a box.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a serious point to this digression: with the boxes that weird rectangle shape, itâ€™s that much more difficult to line everything up along the invisible â€˜gridâ€™ that positions it all. On several ocassions, I couldnâ€™t quite tell if there was a gap somewhere or not.</p>

<p>So the first 20-30 levels or so are all pretty straightforward, some are downright disappointing, particularly when the solution is trivially easy, even still at this stage. But, then, there are some really well designed, fun-to-play, challenging levels. Level 28, for example, was the first that really grabbed me as an excellent puzzle level. Level 29, in contrast, was pedestrian â€” just no challenge at all. Then came Level 35, which was absolutely delightful, a real gem of a level.</p>

<p>I really did feel grateful for these wonderfully well put-together levels, but overall quality was inconsistent. There mustâ€™ve been about 10-15 very good levels, 30-40 almost pointless ones, and about half middling.</p>

    <figcaption>Iâ€™ll finish on a high point, with one of the best levels in the game. The boxes here have to be pushed through the bottom channel, but getting them all into that space is trickyâ€¦</figcaption>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p class="emoji">ðŸ˜•</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a bit confused by this game. It has lots of flaws I could point at across the board. The only area in which itâ€™s totally free from criticism, really, is visually: the graphics are clean, attractive, funny, just enough to add some colour to the gameplay without distracting from it.</p>

<p>But, despite all the areas in which it falls slightly short, I still enjoyed playing the game. It was fun to pick up, play a few levels of, then move onto something else. I played the last 40-50 levels in one sitting, and that was fun, too. Itâ€™s a good handheld game, perfect for travel. Itâ€™s sorely in need of some better level design, though.</p>

<p>
    I played <cite>Super Box Land Demake</cite> for <b>5</b> hours, about 50/50 docked / handheld. Iâ€™m going to be honest: having completed it, this game has almost zero replayability, for me at least.

<p>I played &amp; reviewed <cite>Super Box Land Demake</cite> as part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IndieSelect">#IndieSelect</a> initiative run by <a href="https://twitter.com/Xinthus">@Xinthus</a>. It meant that I received a copy of the game for free; the game is priced at <b>Â£4.99</b> normally.</p>

<p>The game was developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/byJulianoLima">Juliano Ferreira de Lima</a> and ported by <a href="https://twitter.com/RatalaikaGames">Ratalaika Games</a>.</p>
