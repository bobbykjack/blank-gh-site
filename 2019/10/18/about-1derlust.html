<h1>About 1derlust</h1>

<p><a href="https://bobbyjack.me/1derlust">1derlust is a game</a>. A rather silly one, certainly; and incredibly simple one, undoubtedly ‚Äî I‚Äôve described it as making ‚Äú<cite>Pong</cite> look like <cite>Breath of the Wild</cite>‚Äù, which is only a small exaggeration. But, nevertheless, it <em>is</em> a game.</p>

<img style="display: block;" src="/images/1derlust.png" />

<p>The game arose out of two thoughts: a) what would a 1-dimensional game be like? b) will I ever manage to get something, <em>anything</em>, finished and released, no matter how trivial it might be? I‚Äôm delighted to be in a position where both of those questions are answered, sort of.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>You play a white square, destined to bounce across the screen from left-to-right and back again, for all eternity. Or until you die. Score points by pressing a key (or tapping the screen) when your piece is over the checkered target (finish line?), at which point the target will regenerate elsewhere. As you play, speed and acceleration will gradually increase, whilst the targets themselves will shrink over time.</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs it, really. Go for your own personal high score: 110 is my record so far.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm not really expecting to develop this much further, but there <em>are</em> two possible next steps:</p>

<h3>Further development</h3>

<p>If there is enough (i.e. any) interest in the game at all, I‚Äôll consider some low-key maintainance, and maybe some extra features. I‚Äôve certainly got some ideas for new mechanics, bonus targets, etc. I also think there‚Äôs some potential for other ‚Äò1d‚Äô games; maybe I‚Äôll do a series</p>

<h3>Other games</h3>

<p>Aside from that, I‚Äôm hoping that actually finishing (soft of) a game (sort of) will encourage me to get other, more ambitious projects off the ground. It‚Äôs incredibly satisfying releasing something even as basic as 1derlust!</p>

OK, so I‚Äôve got a confession. I can never finish anything. Almost literally never. I have SO many projects in almost every state other than ‚Äòcompleted‚Äô, and it pains me. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs pathological ‚Äî I just cannot get to the release stage.

And, although I love to play games, and I love to review them, I‚Äôve always wanted to write a game of some sort. Something to call my own. I remember, about the age of 10, plotting out sprite grids for a C64 game I wanted to write, about a crab.

So, is it ever going to happen? I really do hope so ‚Äî I want a creation. In the meantime, though, I just decided ‚Äòf‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî it‚Äô, today, I‚Äôll just produce THE simplest possible game I can, just get SOMETHING DONE. And, to my great surprise, I did.

But, seriously, it‚Äôs simple. It makes pong look like Breath of the Wild. I call it ‚Äò1derlust: the 1 bit, 1d, 1 button challenge‚Äô. It even works on mobile, where it probably belongs. https://bobbyjack.me/1derlust

I got to thinking about what a ‚Äò1d‚Äô game would be like ‚Äî it turns out it‚Äôs basically like the golf swing (or, more specifically, the digging mechanic) in Golf Story. (yay Golf Story üòÄ https://bobbyjack.me/2019/05/13/golf-story)

It‚Äôs almost no code, but what there is, is up on GitHub (https://github.com/bobbykjack/1derlust). I hope at least 1 other human being in the world gets some enjoyment out of this ridiculous exercise; if you can beat my 140 high score, let me know!
