<h1>Bunner</h1>

<h2>The project</h2>

<p>Starting in October 2019 — and continuing, potentially, indefinitely! — I will be working on a simple little JavaScript game, called ‘Bunner’. The aim is to do this ‘in public’, and treat it very much as an experiment to see if I can manage to get something to release. I’ll <a href="https://github.com/bobbykjack/bunner">host all the sourcecode on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The game is inspired by this adorable guy:</p>

<p>I’ll probably try to stick to one core concept — whether it be a gameplay change, refinement of graphics, or a new level — each time, so progress will be very incremental, slow but — hopefully — steady.</p>

<p>I’m going to be ruthless: no prevaricating over how terrible it is and whether to push a version, just do it! It may be rough around the edges, but I’m going to try to make this approach work.</p>

<h2>About the game</h2>

<p>I’m keeping extensive notes throughout the process — I’ve had a lot of thoughts about this game which I’m trying to set down on paper. Here’s a brief summary of what I have planned:</p>

<p>Bunner will be a game about a bunner and his life, or an episode in it. It will be a turn-based, top-down, 2d puzzler.</p>

<p>One example plot might be escaping from a farmer. Another might be battling a horde of hares … who knows?</p>

<p>It will be inspired by games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban"><cite>Sokoban</cite></a>, <a href="https://hempuli.com/baba/"><cite>Baba Is You</cite></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ9Pu9Usk5o"><cite>Bomberman</cite></a>, etc. It won’t be as <em>clever</em> as <cite>Baba Is You</cite>; it will harvest complexity — and, hopefully, fun — from a combination of large game boards — possibly up to 40*20, maybe bigger depending on zoom options — and many varieties of special object which affect the gameplay in a number of different ways.</p>

<p>Many terrains will cause Bunner to lose health with each move, so the challenge will be to complete the level within a certain number of turns. Some objects will restore health. Other objects might ‘grow’ in a similar manner to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>, cellular automata, etc. It’s possible that there will be a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metroidvania/">metroidvania</a> element, and I might try to incorporate multiple vertical heights in an interesting way, but everything’s pretty much up-for-grabs at this stage.</p>

<h2>Version 0.1</h2>

<p>So, without further ado, <a href="/2019/10/02/bunner/bunner.html">here’s the first version</a>. Here, we see the absolute minimal ‘working’ game, which is just a foundation on which to build rather than anything meaningful in its own right!</p>
