<h1>Bunner takes a walk</h1>

<h2>Version 0.2</h2>

<p><a href="/2019/10/03/bunner-0.2/bunner">This version</a> introduces a second
    tile, containing a flag, representing the win condition. Bunner can now move
    but this is still largely hard-coded to handle the single movement that can
    actually be made in the level.</p>

<p>Sprites — for Bunner and the flag — are simply strings of characters which
    get split up into two-dimensional arrays (by the
    <code>processDataString</code> function). Each sprite contains different
    characters which, in turn, represent different colors. So, for example, in
    the sprite:</p>

<pre><code>xx
yy</code></pre>

<p><code>x</code> represents one color, y another. For now, Bunner and the flag
are both 8x8 sprites, each ‘cell’ taking up 4x4 pixels on-screen for a total
32x32, which is our current tile size. Note that this creates sprites that are
‘edge-to-edge’ which might well be revisited in future.</p>

<p>The <code>dialog()</code> function, which allows us to inform the user when
    they've completed the level, is not ideal, and may be replaced when we
    eventually build a proper ‘full-screen’ experience. Still, I wanted <em>some
    way</em> of showing the user their final move!</p>

<p>The codebase is now roughly twice the size of the previous version. Next time
round, I plan to implement movement more meaningfully, and possibly refine the
sprite mechanism.</p>
