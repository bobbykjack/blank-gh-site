<h2>Game Boy</h2>

<p><cite>Gum Girl</cite> is an old-school platformer, created for a <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-7">GBJam event</a>, in which the main mechanic is all about blowing gum bubbles and standing on them. This concept might not be the most realistic, but it makes for an entertaining — and often frustrating — platformer.</p>

<h2>Gum</h2>

<p>In the early stages you have two pieces of gum, which allows you to blow two bubbles before needing to ‘recall’ the first. This is a novel tactic because it requires you to think not only about placement, but order — on several occasions, I thought I’d done everything right and pressed the button to recall a bubble, only to realise the one I was standing on was the oldest!</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<p>I found the controls slightly awkward at times — often mixing up ‘jump’ with ‘blow’ with inevitable and hilarious results. Probably this was mostly due to playing on keyboard. Fortunately, time is not much of a factor in the early levels, so you can take time to plan exactly where you should be spitting those bubbles next.</p>

<h2>Puzzles</h2>

<p>Apart from the main mechanic, we’re in familiar platforming territory — spikes as hazards, actual enemies that shoot things later on, stars and life-replenishing hearts to collect. Some sections have gusts of wind (?) which move the bubbles on a path and these set up small puzzles to overcome. On occasion, though, I felt I was bypassing the intended route all too easily.</p>

<h2>Run!</h2>

<p>The final stage is an auto-scroller, thankfully with unlimited gum. This really changes the gameplay quite significantly, from a ‘platformer with thinking’ to a ‘run! run! master those controls!!’ kind of deal. I had to replay this level quite a few times before really getting to grips with it, but it certainly demonstrates a great deal of potential for varying the play. Again, though, I found myself taking a few shortcuts here which certainly didn’t look designed intentionally.</p>

<h2>Solid</h2>

<p>Bubble-blowing is a great technique to allow players to create their own highly-volatile temporary platforms. But unlike those bubbles, <cite>Gum Girl</cite> is solid. The graphics are crisp and clear, especially for just a 4-color palette. The music is cute and catchy, and the levels are well-designed enough to be taxing, but not overly frustrating. For a jam game, it’s a great achievement, and it’s unsurprising that this will be the basis for a future full release, currently in progress.</p>
