<h2>Crisp</h2>

<p>The first thing that struck me about <cite>Lunar Station</cite> is the graphical style: the crisp, pixelly, black &amp; white aesthetic took me straight back to <cite><a href="/2019/06/07/gato-roboto">Gato Roboto</a></cite>, and it’s a style that’s been used successfully in a range of indie titles from <cite><a href="https://minitgame.com">Minit</a></cite> to <cite><a href="http://www.downwellgame.com">Downwell</a></cite>.</p>


<h2>Encroaching darkness</h2>

<p>The gameplay reminds me more of a couple of titles. Some screens (about half) pit the player against a timer, in the form of an encroaching darkness that moves left to right. In all screens, the player is tasked with finding a path from left to right, usually by pushing &amp; pulling boxes around, and activating switches to open doors. This ‘pathfinding under pressure’ triggers memories of <cite><a href="https://slime-san.com">Slime-san</a></cite>, and the box-moving mechanic is certainly nothing new (I’m playing <a href="http://www.ratalaikagames.com/games/superboxland.php"><cite>Super Box Land Demake</cite></a> right now, which is an altogether more relaxed example!)</p>

<h2>Ethereal whispering</h2>

<p>This is all set to a soundtrack that is … unsettling, to say the least. Lots of ethereal whispering, reverb and echo add to the tension, giving an air of ‘horror in space’ that invokes <cite>2001: A Space Odyssey</cite> or <cite>Alien</cite> at their creepiest. It’s very effective.</p>

<h2>Unforgiving</h2>

<p>The puzzles themselves are simple, and each room is on the small size. But it’s unforgiving — one small mistake, and you’ll need a do-over. Some screens caught me out, usually by taking me down the wrong path. The box-moving mechanic, by which you can move them left/right but not up/down, adds to the challenge, and I can see the overall concept making for some pretty tough levels in a full game.</p>

<h2>Harrowing</h2>

<p>Having said that, I’m unsure quite how effectively this would translate to a full game. With a small number of lives, it would be very difficult. With infinite restarts, it might just be too easy. And the linear nature would, hopefully, be more exploratory in a version with a bigger map. The game is tense and, thanks to that soundtrack, quite harrowing to play — this 15-minute prototype might turn out to be as much as most of us can stand!</p>
