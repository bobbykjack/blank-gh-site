<h2>Early</h2>

<p>This is a very early-stage demo: no music or sound, no settings: just the one level to get on with. This also mean the constant on-screen presence of button overlays, which are presumably something to do with a possible touch-screen build.</p>

<h2>Mini-metroidvania</h2>

<p>The game itself — at least, this level — is a simple platformer with three controls: left, right, jump. Some areas get unlocked and there’s at least one hidden shortcut. You can immobilise some enemies, but combat is totally absent: this is a platformer all about avoiding danger.</p>

<h2>Floaty</h2>

<p>In addition to the basics, Lola can float when the jump button is held — this is an essential move to avoid certain obstacles. It’s not a common mechanic, but it works really well here.</p>

<h2>Gato Roboto</h2>

<p>Aspects of this demo reminded me of <cite><a href="/2019/06/07/gato-roboto">Gato Roboto</a></cite>, and it shares a similar charm; I’m not sure quite how far it will push the metroidvania aspect in the full game, but the planned 36 levels should result in a good-sized challenge.</p>

<h2>Character</h2>

<p>Visually, the game is very <cite>Super Mario World</cite>-esque, and the main character Lola is full of character: her death animation is hilarious the first time you see it! All round, the game looks great, and I particularly liked the dimly-lit room shown in the screenshot. In fact, in gameplay terms too, that room was probably the highlight of the level.</p>

<h2>Challenge</h2>

<p>The overall challenge is set at a good level, and it’s a promising start for this delightful concept.</p>
