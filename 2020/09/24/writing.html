<h1>Writing</h1>

<h2>bobbyjack.me</h2>

<p>I have written <a href="/2019/08/01/nintendo-switch-reviews">reviews of 16 Nintendo Switch games</a> for this site, alongside a series of shorter <a href="/2019/10/07/one-hour-reviews">One Hour reviews</a> which are more concise, and cover games Iâ€™ve played briefly, for free.</p>

<h2>Switch Player &amp; Ninty Fresh magazines</h2>

<p>In February 2020, I began writing reviews and contributing features for <a href="http://switchplayer.net/">Switch Player Magazine</a>, an online and print publication. As of October 2020, <a href="http://switchplayer.net/author/bobbyjack/">I have written 20 reviews</a>.</p>

<p>The highlight was undoubtedly my review for <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://switchplayer.net/2020/09/16/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review/">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> which was afforded a <a href="/pdf/super-mario-3d-all-stars.pdf">five-page spread in the October 2020 issue</a>. I also wrote a feature retrospective of <a style="font-style: italic" href="/pdf/baba-is-you-retrospective.pdf">Baba Is You</a> for the July 2020 magazine.</p>

<h2>Medium</h2>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@bobbyjack">On Medium</a>, I write on a range of issues covering gaming, technology, and film. I have written for publications including <a href="https://medium.com/swlh">The Startup</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english">JavaScript in Plain English</a>.</p>
