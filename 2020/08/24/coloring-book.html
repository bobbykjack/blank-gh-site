<h1>Coloring Book</h1>

<p><b>A bare-bones coloring book app that’s worth its asking price</b></p>

<h2>Rainbow Connection</h2>

<p>This review is challenging for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li>For a start, I’m not exactly the target audience of this app, let alone is it something I would normally pick up.</li>
    <li>To compound matters, this is a free download, so anyone can just try it if they’re remotely curious</li>
</ul>

<p>Bearing that in mind, let’s see if there’s anything notable about <cite>Coloring Book</cite>.</p>

<h2>She’s Lost Control</h2>

<p>The first thing you’ll no doubt be wondering is how well the controls work in a coloring ‘game’. <cite>Coloring Book</cite> takes the very wise decision to offer both joycon and touch controls, as anyone would expect and hope for. However, it’s not exactly as straightforward as all that.</p>

<p>When docked, the app can <em>only</em> be controlled using joycons, so put that pro controller to one side. Moreover, each joycon is for a separate ‘player’ (game-centric language really doesn’t work here, does it?!) so a solo artist must control everything with a single joycon.</p>

<p>The touch-screen experience is, of course, the superior one, and it’s more-or-less up to scratch, barring a couple of issues which I’ll cover shortly.</p>

<h2>Paint It, Black</h2>

<p>The main action involves selecting a brush, a color, and applying the latter with the former. This is where joycon controls make things awkward: the UI elements appear when the appropriate button is pressed, but they appear relative to the cursor (paintbrush) which means they’re off the screen a lot of the time. To use them properly, you’ll need to manually move the cursor into the middle of the screen each time, which gets old pretty quick..</p>

<p>Bugs aside, the default set of colors and brushes is reasonable enough to work with. We’ve got a rainbow-plus-brown palette, and standard tools including a paintbrush, flood-fill, and spray can. Bizarrely, the option to undo a move — surely an absolute necessity — is only available in touch mode. Even stranger, there’s an expanded color palette of almost 80 colors … in touch mode. Presumably, non-touch mode is bolted on only because it <em>has to be</em>, and the developer didn’t choose to invest any time in it at all.</em></p>

<p>One of the tools is a nice ‘keep inside the lines’ piece of magic. This is wisely included, since — along with undo — it’s one of the few real advantages a digital coloring book can offer. But it’s not really that different from the flood-fill tool, and most of the other brushes are either boring or not very useful.</p>

<h2>Pictures Of You</h2>

<p>In this free version, there are just a couple of pictures available to color: a jungle scene, and a space-based set-piece. Additional drawings are available as paid DLC — this is the entire reason this app is available for free, after all.</p>

<p>When you choose a picture to color, you actually then select one <em>part</em> of the larger image at a time; the example I tried was divided into six smaller pieces. This is by far the most interesting aspect of <em>Coloring Book</em>, although I’m unsure whether it was really intentional or if the developer just went that way because they didn’t want to implement a zoom (btw, there’s no zoom).</p>

<p>But this approach <em>does</em> mean coloring separate images, then seeing them joined together as a whole, and that can make for quite a humorous/interesting result. If you actually take your time and plan things, I’m sure it’s possible to ensure the image matches up correctly, but you can’t copy+paste colors, so trial and error or strict adherence to the basic color set will help.</p>

<h2>Colour Me In</h2>

<p>In conclusion, there’s a reason <em>Coloring Book</em> is free, and that’s to sell DLC. But the two included pictures, open-ended ‘whiteboard’ mode, and two-player tabletop mode should offer young colourists a brief diversion, so long as they’re patient enough to grapple with the awkward controls.</p>
