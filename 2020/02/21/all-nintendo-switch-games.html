<h1>All Nintendo Switch games</h1>

<p>This is a list of all Nintendo Switch games that I’ve played, in approximate order of preference, as of Feb 2020. This is just <em>my opinion</em>, which is <em>highly subjective</em> and is based purely on <em>how I’m feeling today</em>. I revise the list regularly; titles may go up as well as down.</p>

<p>Games that I’ve reviewed are linked to that review. All others are awaiting review. They are strong candidates for moving in the list when that review happens.</p>

<p><b>Games in bold</b> are new to the list since <a href="/2019/07/28/all-nintendo-switch-games">the last time</a>.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Breath of the Wild</li>
    <li>Super Mario Odyssey</li>
    <li>Super Mario Maker 2</li>
    <li>Hollow Knight</li>

    <li>Tetris 99</li>
    <li><b><a href="/2019/09/05/baba-is-you">Baba Is You</a></b> — I’m still playing this amazing puzzler, from time-to-time, since it has so much post-game content.</li>
    <li><b>Star Wars Pinball</b> — Although I’ve yet to review it (because I’ve still only played a handful of tables included!), this game has made me fall in love with Pinball again!</li>
    <li><a href="/2019/05/13/golf-story">Golf Story</a></li>
    <li><b>Ring Fit Adventure</b> — It’s difficult to compare this fitness game with others, but it’s certainly well done and fairly effective so far.</li>
    <li>Don’t Starve</li>
    <li>New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe</li>
    <li><b><a href="/2020/02/17/yokus-island-express">Yoku’s Island Express</a></b> — I’ve placed this highly entertaining pinball-metroidvania just above SteamWorld Dig 2; in truth, they are very similar in quality as well as general feel.</li>
    <li><a href="/2019/04/29/steamworld-dig-2">SteamWorld Dig 2</a></li>
    <li>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</li>
    <li>Super Meat Boy</li>
    <li><a href="/2019/06/07/gato-roboto">Gato Roboto</a></li>
    <li>Arcade Archives: VS Super Mario Bros</li>
    <li><a href="/2019/04/11/the-flame-in-the-flood">The Flame in the Flood</a></li>
    <li><a href="/2019/05/17/the-way-remastered">The Way Remastered</a></li>
    <li>Slime-san</li>
    <li>Sonic Mania</li>

    <li><a href="/2019/06/21/kid-tripp">Kid Tripp</a></li>
    <li>Super One More Jump</li>
    <li><b><a href="/2019/10/26/super-box-land-demake">Super Box Land Demake</a></b> — I enjoyed some levels of this box-pusher a lot, but many were too basic and the overall package was on the slim side.</li>
    <li>GoNNER</li>
    <li><b>Demolition Crew</b> — Still need to revist this one before review. It’s a decent concept, but the implementation has some significant flaws.</li>
    <li>Arcade Archives: Donkey Kong</li>
    <li><a href="/2019/05/14/ding-dong-xl">Ding Dong XL</a></li>
    <li><b><a href="/2019/09/01/box-align">Box align</a></b> — I really didn’t enjoy this 3d puzzler, mainly because of the awkward mechanics and the not-very-thrilling concept.</li>
